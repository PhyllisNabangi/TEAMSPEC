      <p>Prudential Uganda is pleased to announce a bonus payout of UGX 2.5 billion on its clients’ savings for the year 2018, a 67% increase over last year. This was announced by Arjun Mallik the Managing Director, Prudential East Africa at a media dialogue held in Kampala.
        This amount is added onto the clients’ guaranteed amount and paid upon maturity of the policy, loss of life, or disability. The bonus applies to customers who have been consistent in paying their premiums and have completed at least one year with Prudential as at 31st December 2018.
        Prudential has continued to register excellent investment growth from our continued investments in carefully selected assets on behalf of our customers. The profits generated from these investments are then shared with our customers in the form of a bonus every year.
